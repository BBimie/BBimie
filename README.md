### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bimie, fulltime TV Show binge watcher and I also write code on the side.

- ðŸš€ I am transitioning into data engineering, so I am open to conversations and opportunities about data engineering.
- ðŸŒ± I have some interesting vizzes and dashboards on my [Tableau Public Profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/bimbo.babatola#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source Data Science and Machine Learning Projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with arranging my life.
